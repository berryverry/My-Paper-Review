## 📌 Overview

Most zero-shot Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) methods use CLIP-based pipelines: generate many masks → score each mask-text pair with CLIP → pick the best.  
But this ignores **spatial relationships** ("left", "next to") and **semantic nuances** in language. Grad-CAM could help by localizing attention, but even that has flaws:

- It often focuses on only part of an object
- It treats all words equally, ignoring the “main” target word in the expression

**IteRPrimE** addresses this in an elegant way:

- 🌀 Iteratively refines Grad-CAM maps to self-correct spatial grounding
- 🔍 Emphasizes the **primary word** in a phrase to improve focus (e.g., “bike” in “the bike on the left of the tree”)

## 🔬 Methodology

### 🔁 Iterative Grad-CAM Refinement (IGRS)

- Each iteration masks out the **most activated** regions to force the model to “look elsewhere”
- Over time, the Grad-CAM expands or shifts its focus — this self-correcting mechanism is especially powerful for positional phrases like “right” or “next to”

### 💡 Primary Word Emphasis Module (PWEM)

- Applies NLP parsing to find the **main noun** (usually the subject)
- Amplifies the Grad-CAM for this token, both **locally and **globally\*\*
- This subtle enhancement helps the model disentangle core from context (e.g., focusing on “girl” in “girl beside the man” rather than being distracted by “man”)

### 🎯 Final Mask Selection

- Once Grad-CAM is refined, a selective mask proposal network uses heatmap peaks + connected components to pick the best mask
- A heatmap-mask similarity score icks the best option — ensuring that the mask not only looks coherent, but also aligns with the refined attention

## 💭 What I Found Insightful

- **This method doesn’t try to do everything.**

  Just a clever use of Grad-CAM + language parsing + iterative feedback.  
  It’s efficient, explainable, and surprisingly robust — especially in **out-of-domain** cases where hallucination usually dominates.

- I also appreciated how the authors didn’t just propose a hack.  
  They explored how and why Grad-CAM fails in zero-shot RIS, and used that to **design structural corrections**.

## 📊 Performance Highlights

Especially strong in:

- Positional phrases
- Long and complex expressions
- Unseen domains

## 🧠 Broader Insight

IteRPrimE reminded me that **grounding language to vision** isn't just about matching words to pixels —  
it's about modeling what **matters most** in a phrase, and **adapting the focus iteratively** when the first guess is off.

It’s not perfect but as a zero-shot method with no training, its robustness and interpretability are impressive.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Reflections

One of the things I appreciated about this paper is its minimalism — no fine-tuning.  
But, limitations still exist.

- **Reliance on Grad-CAM quality**:  
  Grad-CAM was never designed to be precise at the pixel level. While refinement helps, it's still prone to fuzziness, especially in cluttered scenes.

- **Parsing-dependent PWEM**:  
  If the NLP parser misidentifies the primary noun, the whole emphasis mechanism could go astray.

- **No learning = No adaptation**:  
  Zero-shot methods are great for flexibility, but without any learning, the system can't adjust if it repeatedly fails in certain semantic categories.

## 🔮 Future Work Ideas

- Apply IGRS to video Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) tasks
- Replace NLP-based primary word detection with a learned attention module
- Build failure heatmaps to debug which words/regions were mislocalized
