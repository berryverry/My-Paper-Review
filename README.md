# 📝 Paper Review

#### Welcome!

#### This repository is a curated collection of paper reviews I've written after reading and thinking through each work in depth.

I focused on:
- ✍️ Grasping the underlying ideas and motivations
- 🧠 Reflecting on what each paper taught me or challenged in my perspective
- 🔮 Imagining how the work might evolve, be improved, or applied elsewhere

#### I wrote these reviews not just as notes, but as a way to grow as a researcher who thinks critically and connects ideas.
